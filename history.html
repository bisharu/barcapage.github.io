                On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended Walter Wild (the first president of the club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons and formed Foot-Ball Club Barcelona.

                FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. n 1901, the club participated in the first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of silverware, and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1-2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club and Bilbao FC) in the final.

                In 1908, Hans Gamper now known as Joan Gamper became club president, attempting to prevent Barcelona from shutting down. The club was struggling financially, socially, and in performance. They had not won a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on." He was club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, spending a total of 25 years in the role. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquired its own    stadium and thus generated a stable income.

                <h3>2005–2008: Rijkaard’s Final Years & Ronaldinho Era Ends</h3>

                Under Frank Rijkaard, Barcelona enjoyed early success with Ronaldinho, Eto’o, and a young Messi, winning La Liga and the 2006 Champions League against Arsenal. However, inconsistency followed, and by 2008 the team’s form declined, Ronaldinho and Deco were past their peak, and Rijkaard was replaced as Messi rose to prominence.

                <h3>2008–2012: Guardiola Era – The Golden Age</h3>

                Pep Guardiola transformed Barcelona with tiki-taka football, building a legendary side around Messi, Xavi, and Iniesta. The club won the 2009 treble, dominated Spain and Europe, and produced historic performances like the 2011 Champions League final against Manchester United. This period is considered Barça’s golden age, though Guardiola stepped down in 2012.

                <h3>2012–2014: Tito Vilanova & Tata Martino Transition</h3>

                Tito Vilanova led Barcelona to a 100-point La Liga season despite health struggles, but the team faltered in Europe. Gerardo “Tata” Martino followed, reaching the Copa del Rey final and battling for La Liga until the last game, but Barça finished without major European glory, signaling a transition period.

                <h3>2014–2017: Luis Enrique Era – MSN & Treble Again</h3>

                Luis Enrique revitalized the team with the attacking trio of Messi, Suárez, and Neymar, winning another treble in 2015. The MSN partnership dominated Europe, combining for record-breaking goals, while Barça also secured domestic doubles. Despite spectacular moments like the 6–1 comeback against PSG, European consistency faded, and Enrique left in 2017.

                <h3>2017–2019: Valverde Era – Domestic Success, European Heartbreak</h3>

                Ernesto Valverde brought stability, winning back-to-back La Liga titles and domestic trophies. However, the era was overshadowed by Champions League collapses—most notably the shock defeats to Roma in 2018 and Liverpool in 2019—despite Messi’s brilliance. Iniesta’s departure in 2018 marked the end of an era, and the team showed signs of decline.
